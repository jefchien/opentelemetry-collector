  This ensures that context cancellation in the exporter doesn't interfere with metric aggregation. The OTel
  SDK currently returns if there's an error in the context used in `Add`. This means that if there's a
  cancelled context in an export, the metrics are now recorded.

# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
